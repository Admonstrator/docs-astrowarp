**Step 4:** 

 * Click the "+" button to add your home router to the network and configure access permissions by dragging and connecting it to the company router.
 * Alternatively, download the AstroWarp app on your client device (e.g., computer or tablet) to directly join the network.

**Step 5:** Change the internet exit to the company router. Then configure your home router and client devices to use the internet exit. This allows you to remotely access services like NAS or GitLab at home using the company router's IP address.

You can now access the company network and its services at any time, with your device's internet IP address appearing as the company's router IP address.
