  *Note: Every router in the network must be signed in to the GL.iNet account.*

## **Connect device to the router**

* If you are configuring for the first time, we **recommend** that you connect the device to the LAN port or WIFI of the router, which is applicable to all scenarios.

* In many cases, our device is already  in the existing network. At this time, we just need to add the router to the existing network. (**Notice:** Only applies to the case where the device is only used as the accessed end or the router is used as the exit node)
