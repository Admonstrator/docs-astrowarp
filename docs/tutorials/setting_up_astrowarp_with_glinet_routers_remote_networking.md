## Preparation

1. Router Compatibility: Confirm that your router model falls under the following list: 
    Note: Models can be different, such as combining Beryl AX (GL-MT3000) and Flint 2 (GL-MT6000).

  **1.1 Supported Firmware Versions**

  Minimum Required Firmware Version: 4.7.0 or higher

  **1.2 Supported Models**

  Spitz AX (GL-X3000)

  Puli AX (GL-XE3000)

  Beryl AX (GL-MT3000)

  Flint 2 (GL-MT6000)

 Brume 2 (GL-MT2500/GL-MT2500A)

 Flint (GL-AX1800) Coming soon

 Slate AX (GL-AXT1800) Coming soon

2. Firmware Version: Ensure the firmware version is 4.7.0 or higher.

3. Login to GL.iNet Account: Follow the instructions below to log in to your GL.iNet account and bind your device.

  *Note: Every router in the network must be signed in to the GL.iNet account.*

4. Connect the devices you need to access to the router or the upstream network of the router.

## **Creating the Network**

**Step 1:** Set a Network Name: Choose a name for your network, such as "mynet."

Once access is granted, a virtual IP will be automatically assigned. You can view this by clicking on the corresponding router in the topology diagram.

*Note: Access between devices will occur via the virtual IP. You can perform a simple test using the ping command.*

## **FAQ** 

**Q:** What should I do if I cannot ping after following the setup steps?

**A:** First, ensure you are using the virtual IP for access and that the username and password are correct. If the issue persists, please check the firewall settings on the device being accessed.
