# Setting Up AstroWarp with GL.iNet Routers: Remote Access

This document outlines how to use your home network as an internet exit while traveling. By accessing the internet through your home network, you can ensure security and privacy while bypassing some traditional VPN limitations. For example, many services like Netflix restrict the use of VPNs in various situations. However, if you access the internet through your home network, you will not encounter these restrictions.

## **FAQ** 

**Q:** After setting the Travel node to use the internet exit, why is there an issue refreshing service websites?

**A:** After setting the exit node, the network may briefly disconnect, causing devices to be unable to access service websites and the internet. Please wait a moment (no more than 1 minute) for the connection to restore.
